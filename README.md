### Game Ideas
- Items cost money from marketplace, but are unlocked according to level
- Player levels up from minigames
- Player learns skills from minigame? (Like sprint, picking stuff up, dash)?
- Right click + dash = whole row harvest
- Upgrade tiles to prevent weed growth? (Don't know why weed growth is bad yet - maybe it's just annoying)?
- Player starts off in overgrown greenhouse. Needs to clear land as he goes. (If above turns out?)

### TODO Checklist
- [x] Plant grows one frame per water
- [x] Pot unwaters after each growth frame
- [x] Player gets points(?) after harvesting
- [x] Harvest reward depends on stage of growth
- [x] Hydro Pot requires one water per growth cycle
- [x] Inventory determines left click
- [x] Inventory determined by scroll wheel
- [x] Object outlined in white before swinging at it
- [x] Pots(their sprites) have a level that lettuce checks
- [x] Player picks up pots with left click (doesn't break them)
- [x] Picked up object moves with player animation
- [x] Each seed takes one point
- [x] Add points to screen
- [x] Add Watering can
- [x] Prioritize breaking lettuce?
- [x] More generous player swing box
- [x] Only highlight object that player will pick up / Next closest item
- [x] Change Repeated Items Draws to Updates where applicable
- [ ] Water can empties on use / Refills on set down
- [ ] Water can changes position on pour

#### For later
- [ ] Object flashes white when hit?
- [ ] Player's hands disappear when object is being carried
- [ ] Can stack items on pick-up (shown with number, somehow)
- [ ] Shop to buy/sell items (Lettuce lovers Greenhouse Marketplace (LlGMa))

#### Eh
- [ ] Full grown lettuce gives one extra point?
- [ ] Plants grow slower if not watered
- [ ] Regular water takes one point
- [ ] Hydro water takes two points

#### Done
