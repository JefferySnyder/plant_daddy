### Game Ideas
- Items cost money from marketplace, but are unlocked according to level
- Player levels up from minigames
- Player learns skills from minigame? (Like sprint, picking stuff up, dash)?
- Right click + dash = whole row harvest
- Upgrade tiles to prevent weed growth? (Don't know why weed growth is bad yet - maybe it's just annoying)?
- Player starts off in overgrown greenhouse. Needs to clear land as he goes. (If above turns out?)

### TODO Checklist
- [x] Plant grows one frame per water
- [x] Pot unwaters after each growth frame

- [x] Inventory determines left click
- [x] Inventory determined by scroll wheel
- [x] Object outlined in white before swinging at it
- [x] Pots(their sprites) have a level that lettuce checks
- [x] Player picks up pots with left click (doesn't break them)
- [x] Picked up object moves with player animation
- [x] Each seed takes one point
- [x] Add points to screen
- [x] Add Watering can
